    <h1>Audio capture and SPL viewer</h1>
    <p>
      This program will open Macbook's "Built-in Microphone" and start listening and rendering the waveform when you press "Capture".<br/>
      Code is just baked<br/>

    <h2>Build and run</h2>
    <p>Easier way to run this is in Intellij, open the project folder as a java project, add any dependencies needed and create a new Run configuration, "Application"</p>

    <h2>Todos</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Verify that the processing of multi bytes (for 16 and 24 bit signals) is correct</li>
      <li>Investigate why the sign of each byte, in the multi-byte case again, may be different</li>
      <li>Convert display from linear to logarithmic (show decibels; at the moment the value of each samples is printed as is)</li>
      <li>Any suggestions for dependency management and easier setup (and alternatives to maven) welcome!</li>
      <li>Find an easy way to build an all-inclusive jar (with or without maven shade plugin) so we can run this with "java -jar"</li>
    </ul>
